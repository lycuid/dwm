My personal fork of suckless' dwm. (https://dwm.suckless.org/)

installed patches:
  - namedscratchpads.
  - movestack.

manual code changes:
  - statusbar tags/ltsymbol colors, padding, highlight colors etc updated.
  - floating window centered by default (for scratchpads' sake).
  - monocle layout hides border (kinda hacky version).
